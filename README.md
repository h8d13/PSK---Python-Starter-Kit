If this worked you will now see:

The venv shows we have selected it. 


## Explorer

In your explorer you now have a .venv (the .env is something different for API keys).
This is a portable python executable.

**Try to keep your projects organized. There are some rules for folders and file names:**

DIRECTORIES

my_package
mypackage
company_project

MODULES

utils.py
database_connector.py
auth_helper.py

No spaces, capitals, or (-,.)

## Running files

You can then simply right click a python file:

Some things that are useful here, copying paths or relative paths. Or running the script. 

Then in your hello.py put the following content:

```
import sys
print (f'{sys.executable}')
```

If you run this and get "yourfoldername\.venv\Scripts\python.exe "

Well the set up worked because it's using the new mini-python we created.
